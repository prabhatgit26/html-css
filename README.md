# India Restaurant :


During my learning of basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I developed a restaurant website to practice these technologies. The project showcases a responsive user interface (UI) with multiple pages that allow users to navigate the site easily.

HTML & CSS: Structured and styled the website with a clean and modern look, using CSS to enhance layout, typography, and visual appeal.


Bootstrap: Utilized Bootstrap components and grid system to ensure responsiveness and consistency across different devices.


Pages: Created key pages including Home, Menu, Gallery, About Us, and Contact, each offering relevant information and functionality.


This project demonstrates my foundational skills in front-end development and UI design.
